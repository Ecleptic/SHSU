- ## Empirical Rule
  - If the distriution then we can use Empirical rule to find the approximate number of observations within two interval values
    - For a bell-shaped distribution approximately:

  1. 68% of the data values lie within two standard deviations of the mean.
  2. 95% of the data lies within two standard deviations of the mean.
  3. 99.7% of the data values lie within three standard deviations of the mean.
x̄ = 0 (in the center of the graph)
x̄ - 1 standard deviation (on the left)
x̄ + 1 standard deviation (on the right)


- ## Chebyschev's Theorem
  - For any number k greater than 1, at least (1-1/k^2) of the data values lie within k standard deviation of the mean. For k=2, at least (1-1/2^2)=1-1/4=3/4 or 75% of the data values lie within two standard deviations of the mean.

  > But what is K? and how to find it?
  > x̄-k*s=56.4
  > x̄+k*s=86.4

```
  y= B0 + B1 X + E        (line best of fit)

  B0 = intercept
  B1 = Slope
  X = Independent variable
  Y = response
  E = error

  ```
