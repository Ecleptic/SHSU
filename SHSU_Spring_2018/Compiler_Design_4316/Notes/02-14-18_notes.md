# Parsing
- The task of parsing is to determine the parse tree.
- (33) W is 0 or more because it can be an empty
- if any derivation exists, a leftmost one exists, and a right-most one does as well.
- slide 36 makes literally no sense to me.
- the dangling *else* is a language design issue.
- begin SS end
    - always re-writing the ending non-terminal we have.
