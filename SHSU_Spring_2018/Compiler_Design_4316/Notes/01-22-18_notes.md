> All this goes in the symbol table

* # Lexical Analysis

  \*

  * Alpha := beta 3.0 \* gamma;
  * id alpha -- blanks discarded
  * asgn :=
  * plussyn +
  * realLit 3.0
  * mulSym \*
  * id gamma
  * semi ;
  * Things it might catch...
    *      :: into : :

* # Semantic Analysis:
  * checks fore semantic errors
  * gathers type info
    * Type checking & type coercion
  * > Error Message Handler also Interacts with those
  *
* ### Compiler Cousins
  1. preprocessors
  2. assemblers
  * pass 1 generates symbol table
  3. linkers / loaders

## Programming language defined by:

* Syntax
  * what do the programs "look like"
  * BNF ("Context-free grammars)
  * Translate from CFG (Context free grammar) syntax-directed translation
* Semantics
  * Semantics deals with: "what do the programs mean?"
  * use English (Natural language)
*

Steps:

#### Source

1. Character string -->
2. input into lexical analyser -->
3. stream of tokens -->
4. syntax directed translator -->
5. Intermediate code

* ### CFG
  * set of rewriting rules (productions)
  * A --> B C D ...
    * A := Left Hand Side (LHS)
      * Exactly one symbol on this side
    * B C D ... := Right Hand Side (RHS)
* <Sentence> --> <noun phrase><verb phrase>
* ### Two Types of symbols
  * Terminal symbols
    * tokens
    * never re-written
  * Non-Terminal systems
    * has to be re-written
