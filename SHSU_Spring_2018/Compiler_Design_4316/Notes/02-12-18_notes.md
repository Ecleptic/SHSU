# Syntax
## Parser

We're describing our syntax through Context-Free grammar (CFG)

- #### Roles of the parser
    - Obtain a string of tokens from the lexical analyzer
    - verify that the string can be generated by the grammar
    - report syntax errors (intelligibly)

- #### Errors
    - How to check?
        - If the character isn't the beginning of a real prefix
        - .
- #### CFG Recap
    - cfg is a 4-tuple G = (NTPS) where
        - T is a finite set of tokens (Terminal)
        - N finite.
- Writing out the derivation is an alternative to constructing a parse tree
- ***We view production as a re-writing rule***
