# Parsers

There are 2 types of parsers

1. Top Down
2. Bottom Up

### Top Down Parsers

> Efficient parsers can easily be constructed by hand

* Starts at root
* proceeds towards leads

### Bottom Up Parser

> Handels large class of grammars

> Software tools generally use this method

* Starts at leaves
* Proceeds towards root

Parsers Generally work as a _greedy_ algorithm

> Construct as much of the parse tree as possible before proceeding to the next character.
