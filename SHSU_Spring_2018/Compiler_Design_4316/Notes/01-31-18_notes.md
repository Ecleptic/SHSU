# Abstract Stack Machines

Instructions fall into 3 classes

1. Integer Arithmetic
2. Stack Manipulation
3. Control Flow

Translation of expressions
parsing math... difficult..

    Translation of expressions slide

### Control Flow

* label _l_: target of jumps to _l_; has no other effect
* goto _l_: next instruction is taken from statement with label _l_
* gofalse _l_: pop the top value; jump if it is zero
* gotrue _l_: pop the top value; jump if nonzero
* halt: stop it!ðŸ›‘

translation of statements

|        if        |
| :--------------: |
| code for _expr_  |
| **gofalse out**  |
| code for _stmt1_ |
|  **label out**   |

Tasks of the lexical analysis

* read input characters and output sequences of tokens
* strip out comments ...

## Definitions

* token: terminal symbol in the grammar
* pattern: a rule describing a seto f string matching a particular token
* lexeme: a sequence of characters with a collective meaning
* attibutes of a token: usually only a pointer to the symbol table entry.
* Symbol: used without definition
  * letters and digits
* alphabet: finite set of symbols
  * english alphabet, binary alphabet, ASCII, ...
  * a fixed alphabet is usually denoted by Î£
* String: finite sequence of symbols from a fixed alphabet Î£
  * Length of string, s is |s| = # of symbols S
  * Length of abcabc is 6
