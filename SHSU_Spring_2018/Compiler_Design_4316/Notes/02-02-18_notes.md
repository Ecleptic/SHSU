A fixed alphabet is a Σ
A language is a set of strings over a fixed alphabet.
Union since languages are sets, the union of two languages L1 and L2 is already defined.

Regular Expression:
_The **Regular Expressions** over finite Σ are the strings over the alphabet Σ + { ),(,|,\*} such that:_

Ex1.
if Σ = {a,b}

* (a|b)(a|b) ------ Denotes {_aa,ab,ba,bb_}
* (a|b)\*b -------- Denotes all strings of _a_'s and _b_'s ending in _b_
* a\*b\*a\*
* a\*a (also known as a<sup>+</sup>)
* (ab\*)|(a\*b)
* (a|b)\* = (a\*b\*)\* ------ Denote the same language - all strings of _a_'s and _b_'s
