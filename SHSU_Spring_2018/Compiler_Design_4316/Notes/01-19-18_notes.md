# What is a compiler?

---

* A compiler is a program that reads in a program written in one language _(source lang)_ and outputs an equivalent program in another language _(target lang)_.
  * It can produce error messages.

### Translator vs Interpreter

* Translator:
  * changes languages after and lets something run it afterwards
* Interpreter:
  * translates at the same time as being read.

### Structure editor

* **Analysis Phase**
  * lexical analysis (scanning)
    * groups characters into tokens
  * Syntax analysis (parsing)
  * Semantic analysis (meaning)
* **Code Generation**
    * interacts with the symbol table.

###### Silicon compiler?

* Chips that compile things?
