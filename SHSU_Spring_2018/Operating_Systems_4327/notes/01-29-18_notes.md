# Threads

- Most modern applications are multi-threaded
- threads run within an application
- Amdahl's Law:
    - *N more cores doesn't mean program gets N faster*
    - speedup <= (1/(S+(1-S)/N))
        - N=2 ====> *1.6 speedup*
- ### User Threads & Kernel Threads
    - User Threads
        - Used toMultiple User threads mapped to a kernel thread
        - Now most user threads are now 1-to-1 with OS/Kernel threads
    - Kernel Threads
        - mapped to the O.S. Threads
    - To create and manage threads you usually need a library.


### Java Threads
1. class extends thread
2. class needs a "run" method
3. create object of class
4. call obj.start() --> initialization  & it calls run

``` java
class myThread extendsThread {
    public void run(){
        while(true){
            SOP("wow");
        }
    }
}
```
``` java
class m{
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        myThread thr = new myThread();
        thr.start();
    }
}
```
