# MacOS Info

* ## modes
  * information about every file & directory.
    * inode
  * owner
  * permissions
  * timestamps
  * directory blocks
* Directories are stored as files
  * contents:
    * . own inode#
    * .. parent inode #
    * name file's inode#
* / inode #2 (mac always starts at inode 2)

## Steps to get inode on boot

1.  read inode 2 to get its disk block number -- `block 0`
2.  read `/` disk boock to get inode # of 'users' -- `inode 8`
3.  read inode 8 to get its dosk block -- `block 5`
4.  read disk block 5 to get inode # of 'gsmith' -- `inode 11`
5.  read inode 11 to get its disk block -- `block 2`
6.  read block 2 to get inode # of exam 2 -- `inode 9`
7.  read inode 9 to get its disk block -- `block 6`
8.  read "Who is Binky?" (file)
