# Ch. 3 Processes
### Non-Threaded
___


* Early Processes were jobs. (or batch systems)
    * Eventually we got systems
    * *Process: A program in execution; Process execution must progress in sequential fashion*
        * A process has multiple parts to it.
* ### Process State:
    * The very first thing you want to do when creating a process.
        * Create the loader
        * #### Stack:
            * Code text
            * data
            * call stack
            * *__[space]__*
            * heap
    * A process can have multiple threads
        * Every thread can have its own call stack.
    * Ready queue:
        * resource flow
* ## Mobile Systems.
    * Typically has one true foreground process
    * Has many multiple background processes
        * use `fork` to generate new processes *(not thread)*
