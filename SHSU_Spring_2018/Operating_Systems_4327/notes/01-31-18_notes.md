# CPU Scheduling

> Scheduling: Deciding which process in ready queue to _dispatch_ to the CPU

| non-preemptive                 | pre-emptive                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| first come first served (FCFS) | Round Robin (each gets a specific time quantum, preempt if quantum is up.) |
| Shortest job next              | Shortest remaining Job next                                                |
| priority with secondary        | Preemptive priority                                                        |

* ### Non-Preemptive
  * First come first served (FCFS)
  * Shortest Job Next (SJN)
  * Priority
    * with secondary
* ### Pre-emptive
  * round robin
    * each gets a specific quantum. preempt if quantum is "up"
  * Shortest remaining job next (SRJN)
  * Preemptive priority

---

* ## Dispatch
  * store registers, etc in TCB of process being preempted
  * load regs etc. from TCB os process being dispatched.
* determining length of the next cpu burst

  * average prediction based upon past performance
    * that' a lot of overhead, CPUs don't do that.

* problem: lower priority processes never get a chance to run
* Solution: priority aging, if a process does'nt get a chace, slowly raise its priority.

* Gantt Charts

### Q1

| Identifier | arrival time | cpu burst |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------- |
| a          | 0            | 7         |
| b          | 1            | 5         |
| c          | 3            | 3         |
| d          | 7            | 2         |

---

### First come first serve

| First | Come | First | Serve |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- |
| a 7   | b 5  | c 3   | d 2   |

Turnaround time:
| finish | arrival |
| ------ | ------------- |
| a 7-0 | 7 |
| b 12-1 | 11 |
| c 15-3 | 12 |
| d 17-7 | 10 |
| total | 40/4 = 10 AVG |

### shortest job next

| shortest | job | next |     |     |
| -------- | --- | ---- | --- | --- |
| a7       | d2  | c3   | b5  |

Turnaround time:
| finish | arrival |
| ------ | -------------- |
| a 7-0 | 7 |
| b 17-1 | 16 |
| c 12-3 | 9 |
| d 9-7 | 2 |
| total | 34/4 = 8.5 AVG |

---

### shortest remaining job next

|     |         |     |     |     |
| --- | ------- | --- | --- | --- |
| a1  | b3...b3 | C3  | d2  | a5  |

> after placing the first, check what each processes in queue has left to run... if it's a tie, let the original keep running.

Turnaround time:
| finish | arrival |
| ------ | ------------ |
| a 7-0 | 7 |
| b 17-1 | 5 |
| c 12-3 | 6 |
| d 9-7 | 4 |
| total | 32/4 = 8 AVG |

    Shortest remaining is always the quickest, but it has more context switches

### Round Robin

_pre-empt if something is in the ready queue and current running has been running >= quantum_

**_quantum = 4_**

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a4  | b4  | c3  | a3  | d2  | b1  |

**_quantum = 2_**

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a2  | b2  | a2  | c2  | a2  | dd  |     |     |     |     |
