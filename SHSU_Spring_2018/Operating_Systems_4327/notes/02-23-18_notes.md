# Paging



TLB page goes in frames. looking into a page reference string





| A real program looks like: |
| :------------------------: |
|          Program           |
|            Code            |
|           Stack            |
|            Heap            |





Pages -> frames

if empty frames, it's easy

what if no frames available?

virtual memory

â€‹	 pages can be swapped out to backup store: Disk/SSD

page fault: when page is in backup store and must be brought in.



### Page Replacement

1. FIFO
2. Optimal: look to future
3. last recently used high overhead
4. not recently used. Replace any page not used within some references ago
   1. last 2.
5. Second Chance
   1. not like recently used, look at a page
