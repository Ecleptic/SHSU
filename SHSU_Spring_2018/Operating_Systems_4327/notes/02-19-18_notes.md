# O.S.

1. Process/Thread management
   * scheduling deadlocks
2. Memory Management
   * Partition
   * Segmentation
   * Paging
3. Files
4. Users
5. ....

Source code -> Compiler -> Binary (not necessarily executable) -> Linker -> .exe -> loader -> CPU Run

Swapping memory is usually used in partitioned memory.

## Partition

## Segmentation

* Memory-management scheme that supports user view of memory
* A program is a collection of segments
  * A segment is a logical unit such as:
    * Main Program
    * Procedure
    * Function
    * Method
    * Object
    * Local variables, Global variables
    * Common Block
    * Stack
    * Symbol table
    * Arrays
* Tag on bits to say where the memory is.

## Paging

* Fixed-size pages
* memory uses frames
* page table
  * maps pages to physical frames.
