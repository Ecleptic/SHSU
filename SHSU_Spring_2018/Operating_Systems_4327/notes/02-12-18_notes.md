# Philosophers
Dining-Philosophers problem

semaphore chops[5]=1;
```
Philosopher i
    loop
        chops[i].wait();
        chops[(i+1)%5].wait();
        <eat>
        chops[i].signal();
        chops[(i+1)%5].signal();
        <think>
    end loop
```
There's potential deadlock if all philosophers run `chops[i].wait();` at the same time.

A solution is to have the original code run for only the evens, then the odds run at...
```
Philosopher i -[odds]
    loop
        chops[(i+1)%5].wait();
        chops[i].wait();
        <eat>
        chops[(i+1)%5].signal();
        chops[i].signal();
        <think>
    end loop
```

| thr 0 | thr 1 | thr 2 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A     | D     | G     |
| B     | E     | h     |
| C     | F     | I     |

- Almost finish before I or H are started.
- E & H must finish before C is started



- ### You can use Semaphores for mutual exclusion but it's not as good.
- You can use buffers to have multiple semaphores.
