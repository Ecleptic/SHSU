# Vocabulary
- What is an OS?
    - Something always running that is an intermediary between the user and hardware
    - Interrupt driven
    - Doesn't need a GUI
- What does an OS do?
    - __ease of use__ and *good performance*
    - workstations have dedicated resources but frequently use shared resources from servers
    - one program running at a time is a kernel
    - memory management
    - Storage management


## What happens at startup
1. bootstrap program is loaded at power-up or reboot
    - typically stored in ROM or EPROM, generally known as firmware
    - initializes all aspects of system
    - loads operating system kernel and starts execution

- Interrupts:
    - hardware:
        - devices do something
    - software interrupt
        - called a __trap__.
        - system call
    - polling:
        - Check periodically if there was an interrupt handle
    - vector:
        - immediately handle

caching is nice

# Multiprocessors
-
    - called parallel systems, tightly-coupled systems
    - advantages include:
        1. increased throughput
        2. economy of scale
        3. increased reliability
            - graceful degradation or fault tolerance
    - Two types
        -
        -
- Unix was designed for mainframes.
- Every process is almost guaranteed to run with multiple threads.
- Deadlock: ???



- Applications:
    - They work alongside(or on top of) the operating systems
