Lab 2 is usually the hardest lab of the semester.

# Two Stacks

Always keep this use-case: `stack1 + stack2 <= max`

Need to initially allocate space for dynamic storage.

```
Base[J] = Top[J] = floor((J-1)/N*M)+ L0
```

```
B[1] = T[1]= floor((1-1)/3*10)+0 = 0
B[2] = T[2]= floor((2-1)/3*10)+0 = 3
B[3] = T[3]= floor((3-1)/3*10)+0 = 6

```

## Insertion and Deletion Algorithms

    If N stacks, you want N+1 places in stack
#### Insertion
```ada
Top[K] := Top[K] + 1;
If Top[K] > Base[K+1] then
    report overflow; -- Reallocate additional space
Else
    StackSpace[Top[K]] := Y; -- Insert Y onto Stack
End If;
```
#### Deletion
```ada
If Top[K] = Base[K] then
    report underflow;
Else
    Y:= StackSpace[Top[K]]; -- Remove top item in stack and assign to Y
End If;
```
Stack 1 is never moved <sub>(with queues it's different)</sub>

*Notes Pg: 25*

If stack is full: Use Reallocation of Available Space Algorithm *Pg.22*

*Check file: **SeqReal.doc***

    If available=0 you technically have 1 space left that is 'reserved'
    If it's -1, then you're out of space.

You need to know how much space you want to keep on your program on a case-by-case basis. *"You're the professional"*

## Algorithm MoveStack
___
#### pg. 23

*use after space reallocation*
Either move stacks down and "defrag" space to add to the bottom
***Or***
Move all stacks without overlapping stacks

For the lab, try using the 3 separate arrays, then combine them...

Look at a generic/template

Complex numbers are a built-in data type in ada.
