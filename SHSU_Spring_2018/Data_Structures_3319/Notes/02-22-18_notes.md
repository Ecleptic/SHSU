# Hashing

Take the key and put it into your hash function.

When collisions happen, you need to handle them.

### Weighted Codes
### Square and Extract N Bits
- Name * address == product key

to avoid most collisions, pull from the middle of the string.

*OR* leads to a lot of ones.
*AND*ing is a lot of Zeroes,
so use *XOR*.

Folding: anything that lets you take a long key and combine its parts to a more manageable size.


table size is always a power of two.

`dx:ax`

#### Division Remainder:
quotient + remainder
