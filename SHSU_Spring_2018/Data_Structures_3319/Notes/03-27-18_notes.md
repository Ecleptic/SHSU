# Threaded Trees

How to build the tree initially.
Build it one node at a time. (start at the left)

## Insert into Threaded Binary Tree (in order)

This algorithm attaches a node pointed to by Q as the right subtree of the node pointed to by P if the right subtree is empty... It inserts as a new leaf or inserts existing.

```ada
Q.Rlink := P.Rlink; -- Insrt into Right leaf
Q.Rtag := P.Rtag;
P.Rlink := Q;
P.Rtag := "+";
Q.Llink := P;
Q.Ltag := “-”;

if Q.Rtag = “+” then
    Q$.Llink := Q;
end if;
```
