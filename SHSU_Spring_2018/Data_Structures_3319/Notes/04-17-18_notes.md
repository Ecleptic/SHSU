# Data Structures

## Motivation

* From SHSU Grads
  * Table-Driven Problem Solvers
  * Finite State Automata
  * Problem Decomposition

## Intelligence

2 Types of intelligence

1.  graphical
    * a picture is worth a thousand words (artistic, managerial)
2.  Symbolic Manipulative
    * algebraic/abstract

# Decision Tables

# Exam Questions

* Material Covered:
  * Hashing (3 questions that apply to hashing [answer 1 or two of them])
  * Binary Trees (threaded and non-threaded (multiple questions involving trees {4} at least one answered))
  * Searching
    * sequential
    * binary search (multiple questions)
      * fewer probes but not always the fastest
      * heinzing's 80/20 rule
    * 1 question on Searching
  * '_N_'ary Trees (2 questions)
    * searching them
  * B Trees
    * file systems
    * SQL Databases
  * only 3 mandatory questions (some questions have multiple parts)
    * Will write Algos on at least 3 questions (2 will need an algo and show you know what you're doing)
      * Example (not on test)
        * _after putting the 3rd thing in sorted order of a hash tree, show the state of the hash tree._
* nothing with I/O
* **Sorting will not be on the exam**
