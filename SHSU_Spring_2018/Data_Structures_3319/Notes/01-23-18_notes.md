# Storage Vs Speed.
> You can't have both minimum storage and maximum speed

If you have:

```
with Ada.Text_Io;
use Ada.Text_Io;

procedure Hello is
begin
   Put_Line("Hello Ada!");
end Hello;
```

You can compile it with:

```
gcc -c hello.adb    // hello.ali
gnatbind hello      // hello.o
gnatlink hello      // hello.exe
```

### OR:

```
gnatmake hello.adb
```

## Sequential Allocation vs Dynamic Allocation

* ### Sequential Allocation
  * we know the exact number of items or there is a reasonable upper bound, contiguous allocation
  * if you're going to need the rest of the stuff, you're going to want sequential because you'll be able to find it by base + offset
  * If you need to add or delete, you need to move everything below it on the _'stack'_
  * difficult to combine/concat lists, you need to move _every_ specific node
  * knowing length is fairly easy.
  * sorting generally easier because data is closer.
* ### Dynamic Allocation (linked list)
  * usually useful if you have no prior knowledge on the number of items
  * If you want to randomly insert after the k'th node, then linked list would be be better
  * If you wanna delete the k'th node, you just need to take the pointer and put it lower... ez.
  * easy to combine/concat lists, just change the pointer.
  * finding the length is more difficult because you need to walk through each node.
  * sorting is easier in a linked list?

## Stacks

```
type MyType is record
    F1: array(1..3) of character;
    F2: integer; -- assume 2 bytes/integer (approx 5-6 bytes)
end record;

 LOC (5[j]) = base + offset
            = base + J * C // as C = 5
LOC (x[j])  = 100 + 0 * 5 = 100
         2  = 100 + 2 * 5 = 110

<!--
LOC of next node is:
LOC(X[J+1]) = Loc(X[J])+C
 -->
 Y: Array(1..100) of MyType;

 Loc(X[J]) = Base + C * (J - 1)
 or:
 Loc(X[J]) = Base + C * J



X: array(0..99) of MyType;
```

### Creating a sequentially Allocated Stack

_Easy way to tell if a stack is empty:_
_keep a variable called top. If top === 0, it's empty_


```
max : integer := 10;
type MyType is record
    F1: array(1..3) of character;
    F2: integer;
end record;

stack: array(1..10) of MyType;
top : integer range 0..10 := 0; -- set empty

    -- Method Push
Procedure Push(X: in MyType) is
begin
    -- insert item x into stack
    if(top < max) then
        top <- top + 1;  -- top <- top + C;
        Stack(top) <- X;
    else
        report overthrow -- error condition
    end if;
end Push;

    -- Method Pop

Function Pop() return MyType is
begin
    if(top > 0) then
        top <- top -1; -- top -c;
        return stack(top + 1);
    else
        report underflow -- desired condition
    end if;
end Pop;
```
*queue is faster than linked list because moving the pointer is slow... __apparently__?*

### queue into deque:
Deque === Double-Ended Queue
