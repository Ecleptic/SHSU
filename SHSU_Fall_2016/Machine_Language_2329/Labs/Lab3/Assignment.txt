Write a NASM assembly language program which will:

Print a prompt, asking the user to input an alphabetic character from the keyboard.
Check to make sure the character entered is indeed an uppercase or lowercase letter of the alphabet
If it is, print, with appropriate messages, the character (a) as it's 8-bit binary value, (b) as an uppercase letter,  and (c) as a lowercase letter.
If it is not an alphabetic letter, display an appropriate error message.
Ask the user whether he or she wishes to repeat the process, and accept a char as input.
If the character is "Y" or "y" repeat from step 1; otherwise, exit to DOS
Your program should be completely documented.  (As stated in class and in the notes, this requires that almost every line be commented.)  In addition, there should be a comment at the top with your name, the date, and a brief description of the program.

Turn in your program source via blackboard. Your filename should be nnn-lab3.asm, where nnn represents your initials.    For example, if your name is Sammy Bear Kat, and your sam username is sbk001, your filename should be sbk-lab3.asm.
