SLIDE 3-6
at the transport layer there's TCP or UDP (can be one or the other). The message goes to the transport layer via tcp/udp depending on what it is.
TCP adds headers and info to the message [this piece is called a segment](source's port #, and Destination's port #) then it's sent to the network layer.
the network layer will add to the 'segment' it'll add (Source's IP, and Destination's IP) The whole 'packet' is called a 'datagram'

the whole packet/datagram (IDK what they're called) is sent to the network layer of the new server then gets sent all the way back up (it just reverses that message.)

KNOW MULTIPLEXING AND DEMULTIPLEXING
[Transport layer]
Multiplexing is on the sender's side.

demultiplexing is using the header to deliver the fragments and sockets.
 (it's harder because it can use 2 different protocols)
